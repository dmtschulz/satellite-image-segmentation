# Architectures of Machine Learning Systems SoSe2024: – Sentinel Building Segmentation
This project involved developing a machine learning pipeline to classify building locations in cities using satellite images. The model was trained to identify whether pixels in satellite images from the Sentinel 2 satellite contain buildings. The project included solutions for multiple sub-tasks and a final report detailing the results. Open-source ML libraries were used, and accuracy was tested on specific geographic coordinates.

- Accuracy: detecting buildings with ∼84% IoU.
